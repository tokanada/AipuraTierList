## A brief explanation

I wanted to make this tier list, firstly, to help other players decide on which cards to spent their hard-earned diamonds on. However, I also wanted to see which cards are most commonly used and which cards have been left behind in the meta. This tier list is **judged by my own personal experience** playing the game and seeing which **cards I see the most in both PvP and Regular High Score Lives.** Specialized and niche cards are positioned lower on this tier list while **cards that see action in both, PvP and High Score, are scored higher.** Parts of this list has also been influenced by the current/previous VENUS Race Event. Please keep this in mind.



Also, a sidenote. I left out most of the 2, 3, and 4 star cards because I do not know about the viability of most them. However, the ones I have listed to see occasional use.

### Tier List Tiers

I've decided to divide this tier list into the following tiers.

1. SS Tier - These cards are the most commonly used and see consistent success

2. S Tier - These cards are consistently used, but may or may not have substitutes

3. A Tier - These cards offer near the same viability as the S tier, but see less success

4. B Tier - These cards are often used in niche teams and may require specific team building to fully utilize them

5. C Tier - These cards are rarely used but may show up occasionally in teams

6. D Tier - I literally never see these cards in use

7. ?? Tier - These cards are either too new or I simply don't know enough about them. This could be due to their nicheness or even their inviability in the meta.



And so, without further ado.

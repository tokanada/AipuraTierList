## A brief explanation

I wanted to make this tier list, firstly, to help other players decide on which cards to spent their hard-earned diamonds on. However, I also wanted to see which cards are most commonly used and which cards have been left behind in the meta. 

This tier list is **based on my own personal experience** playing the game and seeing which **cards I see the most in both PvP and Regular High Score Lives.** Specialized and niche cards are positioned lower on this tier list while **cards that see action in both, PvP and High Score, are scored higher.** 

In addition, I've decided to rate Initial Cards a bit more favorly compared to some of the other standard Cards due to their ease of access. I believe that this influence doesn't have a big impact on the validity of the tier list, but instead helps reduce FOMO.

Parts of this list has also been influenced by the current/previous VENUS Race Event. Please keep this in mind.

Also, a sidenote. I left out most of the 2, 3, and 4 star cards because I do not know about the viability of most them. However, the ones I have listed see occasional use.

### Tier List Tiers

| Tier        | Explanation                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SS Tier** | These cards are the most commonly used and see consistent success                                                                                    |
| **S Tier**  | These cards are consistently used, but may or may not have substitutes                                                                               |
| **A Tier**  | These cards offer near the same viability as the S tier, but see less success                                                                        |
| **B Tier**  | These cards are often used in niche teams and may require specific team building to fully utilize them                                               |
| **C Tier**  | These cards are rarely used but may show up occasionally in teams                                                                                    |
| **D Tier**  | I literally never see these cards in use                                                                                                             |
| **?? Tier** | These cards are either too new or I simply don't know enough about them. This could be due to their nicheness or even their inviability in the meta. |


And so, without further ado.
